# Ground-station

Ground Station Software for UAV / Remote Monitoring System

## Overview

Ground-station provides the control, monitoring, and user interface software for the associated UAV or remote system. This repository includes the main application logic, communication interfaces, telemetry handling, and UI components required to operate and monitor connected hardware.

The project is designed with reliability, extensibility, and maintainability in mind. It integrates with communication protocols and displays telemetry data in real time.

## Features

- Real-time telemetry processing
- Communication interface for connected hardware
- Graphical user interface for control and monitoring
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Logging and diagnostics support

## Technology Stack

- [Specify framework or language]
- Local communication protocols
- UI library or framework
